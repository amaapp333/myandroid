          Welcome to The weekly news digest! Every week, we bring you
          important news stories from the world of media – and try to put them
          in a wider context.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week, we have two detailed stories on the recent media shakeup in
          Ukraine and a roundup of other noteworthy media news.
        </p>

          The closure appears to be a continuation of the conflict between the
          publisher and the editorial team, particularly over the plans to
          launch a Ukrainian-language outlet under the paper’s brand. Analysts
          also say the move might be the owner’s attempt to avoid angering the
          authorities – whom Kivan’s construction business depends on – over
          Kyiv Post’s coverage.

          Perhaps the most notable media news story in the CEE region came from
          Ukraine this week with the closure of Kyiv Post, the country’s leading
          English-language publication.

          Over the past several decades, it has been a trusted source of news
          and a lodestar of independent journalism. However, on Monday the
          paper’s owner, construction tycoon Adnan Kivan, announced the outlet
          will close “for a short time,” saying he hopes to reopen it “bigger
          and better” in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyiv Post’s editorial team then released a statement clarifying that
          all journalists were fired effective immediately. The journalists
          called the actions “an act of vengeance” by the owner and an attempt
          to “[get] rid of inconvenient, fair and honest journalists.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The closure has attracted multiple concerned comments from Kyiv Post
          readers, which include high-level foreign diplomats, expats, and
          business leaders. In an interview with Columbia Journalism Review, the
          paper’s now-former chief editor Brian Bonner said he is “talking to
          deeply concerned ambassadors.”
